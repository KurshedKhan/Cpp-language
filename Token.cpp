        Tokens in C
                    Tokens are the smallest individual units in a program.

                    Type of the Tokens

                    3.Constants
                    4.Strings
                    5.Operators
                    6.Special Symbols

                    1.Keywords : The keywords are pre-defined or reserved words in a programming language.

                    auto         double      int        struct
                    break        else        long       switch
                    case         enum        register   typedef
                    char         extern      return     union
                    const        float       short      unsigned
                    continue     for         signed     void
                    default      goto        sizeof     volatile
                    do           if          static     while


                    2. Identifiers are used  the naming of variables, functions, and arrays.

                       1. They must begin with a letter or underscore(_).
                       2. They must consist of only letters, digits, or underscore.
                       3. No other special character is allowed.
                       4. It should not be a keyword.
                       5. It must not contain white space.
                       
                       Note: Identifiers are case-sensitive so names like variable and Variable
                        will be treated as different.

                    3. Constants : The constants refer to the variables with fixed values.\

                        exp. : const int Const_variable = 20;// This value is fixed..

                    6. Special Symbol : 
                                        Brackets[],
                                        Parentheses(),
                                        Braces{},
                                        Comma (, ),
                                        Colon(:),
                                        Semicolon(;),
                                        Asterisk (*)
                                        Assignment operator(=)
                                        Pre-processor (#)
                                        Period (.)
                                        Tilde(~)
